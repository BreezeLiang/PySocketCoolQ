####This is repository is under heavy development, DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION
>


*.e files are souce code for ELang (the Chinese programming language used by CoolQ)

The JSON file in ELang folder is encoded in GBK.

botconfig.py should be created to be used with the exemplary QQ & Telegram tunnelling bot.

Python side is recommended to be started after the initialization of Elang side.

The setup.py file might be crappy, but the library itself is usable.
